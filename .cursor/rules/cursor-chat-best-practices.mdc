# Cursor Chat Rules & Best Practices

(Embed this doc in Project → "Rules" so the agent sees it every turn)

---

## 1  Core Philosophy
- Keep the prompt lean. Only send the code and text that truly matters for the current request.
- Isolate tasks. Separate unrelated work into new chats or tabs.

---

## 2  Context‑Window Management

| Action         | When to use                                                        | Effect                                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| /reset context (or broom icon) | Pivoting to a new sub‑task in the same chat and no longer need earlier attached files | Drops all file/doc context. Keeps chat history & recent messages |
| New Chat (Cmd + N) | Starting a completely different task, or conversation exceeds summarisation limit | Wipes both context and message history                      |
| Large‑Context Mode | Need >32 k tokens intact (specs, long transcripts)             | 2× cost, delays summarisation                               |

**Rule for Agent:** If a reply triggers the yellow "⚠︎ context too long" banner, first suggest /reset context; if still near the limit, suggest a new chat.

---

## 3  Understanding Auto‑Summarisation
1. Cursor counts tokens on every send.
2. If ≥90 % of window → oldest messages summarised into 3‑5 bullets by a small model.
3. Bulky attached files are evicted before chat text.
4. Recent conversation (< ~10 turns) always remains verbatim.

**Agent Best Practice:** Avoid relying on details buried deep in the thread; restate critical info if it will be needed later.

---

## 4  File & Snippet Guidelines
- Attach only the smallest snippet or file section required.
- Remove attachments when done (/reset context).
- Prefer @SymbolName or Search codebase results over pasting entire files.

---

## 5  Workflow Patterns

**Brainstorm → Action**
1. Brainstorm with full context.
2. /reset context.
3. Ask → "Turn the brainstorm above into TODO.md."

**Parallel Threads**
- Keep refactor, doc‑writing, and debugging in separate chats to avoid cross‑pollution.

---

## 6  Cost & Performance Tips
- Watch the price badge; ⚠︎ means large‑context pricing is active.
- Use /reset context to drop MB‑heavy file blobs and return to normal cost.

---

## 7  Quick Reference Commands

/reset context     # Clear file/doc context in current chat
Cmd + N            # New chat tab
Cmd + K → Search   # Quick open files or symbols
Cmd + .            # Stop generation

---

## 8  Pinning Critical Details

If a value (API key, hex string, signature) must stay exact, paste it in a fresh message right before the step that uses it. Cursor treats newest content as sacred and avoids summarising it.

---

## 9  Agent Prompts Cheat‑Sheet
- Suggest reset when heavy context is no longer relevant.
- Suggest large‑context when user explicitly needs huge documents intact.
- Suggest new chat when summarisation is about to hide important reasoning.
