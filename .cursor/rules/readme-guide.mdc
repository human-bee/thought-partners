# README & Documentation Guide

The [README.md](mdc:README.md) is the central documentation hub for this project. It was iteratively improved through a comprehensive review and collaborative process, ensuring it is:

- **Welcoming for new users and developers**: Clear onboarding, setup, and usage instructions.
- **Comprehensive in architecture**: Explains the app's flow, room-based collaboration, TLDraw whiteboard, LiveKit video, and AI-powered transcription.
- **Extensible**: Designed for easy addition of new AI/research features (OpenAI, Perplexity, Anthropic, Deepgram, etc.) and whiteboard customization.
- **Developer-focused**: Points to [for-the-new-dev.md](mdc:for-the-new-dev.md) for deep dives, lists key files/utilities, and describes the global TLDraw editor instance for debugging.
- **Testing & Quality**: Documents the Jest test suite, linting, formatting, and a LiveKit token test script.
- **Troubleshooting & Debugging**: Covers environment variable handling, logging, common issues, and the use of `EnvInitializer` and `clientEnv` utilities.
- **Environment Setup**: Provides a full `.env.local` template, with all required and optional keys for LiveKit, AI, research, and logging.
- **Major Dependencies**: Lists all key libraries and frameworks (Next.js, React, TLDraw, LiveKit, Zustand, TailwindCSS, Jest, etc.).
- **API Endpoints**: Documents all custom API endpoints for token management and AI agent creation.
- **Deployment**: Build instructions, Vercel compatibility, custom CSP, and ESLint notes.
- **Known Issues & Limitations**: Honest about current limitations (e.g., no persistence yet, some AI features are placeholders).
- **Roadmap / Future Enhancements**: Lists planned improvements (persistence, chat, session recording, etc.).
- **Contributing**: Welcoming guidelines for contributors, including PR and issue process.
- **FAQ**: Answers common setup, usage, and contribution questions, added as a result of this collaborative review.

**Process Notes:**
- The README was expanded to reflect not just environment variables, but also the app's architecture, extensibility, developer onboarding, and future plans.
- Iterative improvements were made to ensure nothing important was lost and all new features, developer notes, and troubleshooting tips were included.
- The README is intended as a living document and should be updated as the project evolves.
