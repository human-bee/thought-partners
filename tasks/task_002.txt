# Task ID: 2
# Title: Inventory and Audit Codebase
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: highest
# Description: Conduct a comprehensive audit of the codebase to identify dead code, duplicate logic, vestigial files, and ensure all dependencies and utilities are properly categorized before any code removal or refactoring.
# Details:
This is the first task to complete after project setup and must be prioritized above all others. Use static analysis tools (tsc, ESLint, depcheck) to scan for unused code and dependencies. Manually review code for redundant logic, outdated test/dev utilities, and commented-out code. Document all findings in a cleanup checklist. No code should be removed or refactored until all audit subtasks are completed and findings are reviewed.

# Test Strategy:
Run static analysis tools and review output. Manually verify findings with codebase walkthrough. Confirm that all audit subtasks are completed and findings are documented before proceeding to any code removal or refactoring.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit Token Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review all token-related endpoints (get-token, livekit, refresh-token, create-agent) and identify which are used in production versus legacy/experimental.
### Details:

<audit-update timestamp="2025-05-17T01:47:09Z">
  <summary>
    <p>Token endpoint audit completed for src/app/api/. Identified four key endpoints: get-token, livekit, refresh-token, and create-agent. All endpoints use LIVEKIT_API_KEY and LIVEKIT_API_SECRET from environment variables and generate JWT tokens with various grants and permissions.</p>
  </summary>
  <findings>
    <p><strong>get-token/route.ts</strong>: Canonical, production-ready endpoint for LiveKit token generation. Supports both GET and POST, used for backward compatibility and new flows.</p>
    <p><strong>livekit/route.ts</strong>: Alternate implementation for LiveKit token generation. Appears to be legacy or used for specific flows; actual usage in client code needs verification.</p>
    <p><strong>refresh-token/route.ts</strong>: Generates new tokens for existing identities/rooms, supporting token refresh flows. Usage in client code needs confirmation.</p>
    <p><strong>create-agent/route.ts</strong>: Experimental/dev-only endpoint. Contains stubs and references to unimplemented features (e.g., Deepgram integration). Not used in production.</p>
  </findings>
  <next-steps>
    <p>Confirm actual usage of livekit, refresh-token, and create-agent endpoints in client code. Prepare a cleanup/consolidation plan after full audit. No code changes made yet; awaiting further audit steps before refactor/removal.</p>
  </next-steps>

## 3. Logger Utility Review [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Compare src/components/videoconference/VideoLogger.ts and src/utils/VideoLogger.ts for duplication and usage, and decide on a single implementation.
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-17T01:51:35.604Z>
<log><timestamp>2025-05-17T01:51:32Z</timestamp><entry>Two VideoLogger implementations have been identified: src/utils/VideoLogger.ts (class-based, static methods, hardcoded prefix, environment check via process.env.NODE_ENV) and src/components/videoconference/VideoLogger.ts (object-based, configurable log levels, dynamic verbosity via NEXT_PUBLIC_LOG_LEVEL, environment-aware). Initial assessment indicates the latter is more flexible and production-ready, supporting dynamic log levels and environment-based configuration. The next steps are to audit actual usage/imports of both utilities in production code, recommend consolidation on the more flexible implementation, and prepare a cleanup plan after full audit. No code changes have been made yet; awaiting further audit steps before refactor/removal.</entry></log>

## 7. Generate Module Dependency Graph [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use Madge to generate a module dependency graph for the codebase to identify orphaned modules and circular dependencies.
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-17T01:56:25.670Z>
<update><timestamp>2025-05-17T01:56:21Z</timestamp><content>Madge was executed on the src directory to generate a text-based module dependency tree. Only 5 files were processed: mocks/fileMock.js, mocks/livekit-client.js, mocks/styleMock.js, scripts/debug-token.js, scripts/test-token.js. No circular dependencies or orphaned modules were detected in the processed files. The low file count indicates Madge may not have traversed all TypeScript/Next.js files, likely due to configuration or file extension issues. If a more comprehensive dependency graph is required, consider adjusting Madge's configuration to include .ts/.tsx files or evaluate alternative tools such as Skott or dependency-cruiser. No immediate code changes are recommended until further audit steps are completed.</content></update>

This time, 75 files were processed, including all main app, component, context, controller, and utility files. No circular dependencies or orphaned modules were reported. The module structure is healthy and no major dependency issues were found. The audit can proceed with confidence in the current module organization. No code changes have been made yet. Awaiting further audit steps before considering any refactor or removal actions.</content></update>

## 8. Identify Unused Exports via ts-prune [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run ts-prune to detect exported functions and types that are not used anywhere, listing files safe to remove.
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-17T01:58:37.821Z>
<update><timestamp>2025-05-17T01:58:33Z</timestamp><content>ts-prune was executed to scan the codebase for unused exports. The scan identified several exported functions, components, and types that are not imported or used anywhere in the project. Examples include LiveKitTest, PreJoin (default and JoinOptions), TLDrawDebugger, TestControls, TranscriptionCanvas, useIsClient, INSTANCE_MARKER, and various default exports in Next.js page files. Many of these exports are related to development, testing, or legacy features, and some are only referenced within their own module. These findings are candidates for removal or refactoring during the upcoming cleanup phase. No code changes have been made yet; further audit steps are required before proceeding with refactoring or removal. This step ensures that the codebase remains lean and maintainable by eliminating dead code and unused exports, which can otherwise increase bundle size and complicate maintenance.</content></update>
