# Task ID: 3
# Title: Consolidate Token Endpoint Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Merge all token endpoint logic into a single, well-documented API route.
# Details:
Consolidate token generation endpoints into a single Next.js API route using the App Router and Route Handlers. Focus on src/app/api/get-token/route.ts as the canonical, production-ready endpoint for LiveKit token generation. Merge logic from livekit/route.ts and refresh-token/route.ts into get-token to unify GET, POST, and refresh flows. Remove or archive create-agent/route.ts (experimental/deprecated) unless required for a future AI-agent feature; consider feature-flagging if kept. Ensure all client calls (e.g., JoinRoomForm) reference only /api/get-token after consolidation. Verify environment variable usage (LIVEKIT_API_KEY, LIVEKIT_API_SECRET) remains consistent across the unified endpoint. Implement proper authentication using NextRequest for token validation. Update all client-side calls to use the new endpoint. Document the API and usage thoroughly.

# Test Strategy:
Test token generation via the new endpoint. Verify all existing client integrations work. Run unit and integration tests. Test both static and dynamic route parameters. Ensure proper authentication flow works with the consolidated endpoint. Verify environment variables are correctly used across all token generation flows.

# Subtasks:

<info added on 2025-05-17T04:17:25.554Z>
No extra documentation file is required; the top-level README will serve as the primary source for API documentation. The README will be updated to include all necessary details for the `/api/get-token` endpoint, covering supported methods (GET/POST), required and optional parameters (`room`, `username`, `refresh`), example requests (including curl snippets), response format (`{ token: string }`), error handling (HTTP status codes and messages), and authentication requirements (using `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` and `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` environment variables). The refresh token flow, previously handled by `refresh-token/route.ts`, will be documented in the README, including instructions for requesting and using refresh tokens. Best practices for passing tokens in requests using NextRequest will be included, along with a migration guide mapping legacy endpoints to the new `/api/get-token` endpoint. The team will review the updated README before marking the subtask as done.

## 5. Implement Middleware for Token Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add middleware for logging and authentication to the token endpoint.
### Details:
Create a higher-order function to wrap the token handler with logging and authentication logic. This will help with debugging and securing the endpoint. Use NextRequest for proper token validation as identified in the audit.
<info added on 2025-05-17T04:17:37.326Z>
Per MVP de-bloat sprint, implementation of middleware for logging and authentication around the token endpoint is deferred to a future phase after core cleanup. This will allow the team to focus on removing unused code and streamlining the core token endpoint logic first. Once core cleanup is complete, this subtask will be revisited to add robust middleware for logging, request validation, and authentication, ensuring best practices for token security and observability are followed. For now, only basic token validation (as identified in the audit) will remain in place, with no additional middleware layers added.

## 6. Clean Up Unused Token-Related Exports [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove or refactor unused token-related exports identified in the audit.
### Details:
Based on the audit results, identify and remove unused exports like getTokenInfo and other token-related functions that are no longer needed after consolidation. Run ts-prune after removals to confirm no new orphans remain.
<info added on 2025-05-17T04:19:55.558Z>
To clean up unused token-related exports, first run ts-prune to detect any unused exports in the codebase, with a focus on token-related files and utilities. Manually review the flagged exports to confirm they are not used in production or tests, including edge cases such as test utilities or mocks. Remove or refactor any unused exports (e.g., getTokenInfo or other vestigial token functions) as identified. After removal, run ts-prune again to confirm no new orphans remain. Finally, run the full test suite and manually verify that token flows (whiteboard, transcription board, videoconference) still work as expected. Log all findings and actions in this subtask before marking as done. This process ensures that only necessary exports remain, reducing technical debt and improving maintainability.

## 7. Implement Authentication with NextRequest [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure proper authentication is implemented in the consolidated token endpoint using NextRequest.
### Details:
Use NextRequest in the endpoint request type for proper token validation as recommended in the Next.js documentation and GitHub discussions. Implement authentication checks following best practices for Next.js App Router. Test the authentication flow thoroughly to ensure security of the token endpoint. Refer to the NextRequest implementation pattern for token validation in Next.js App Router.
<info added on 2025-05-17T04:34:17.370Z>
Implement minimal authentication for the /api/get-token endpoint using NextRequest. For the MVP, check for a Bearer token in the Authorization header of the incoming request. If the token is missing or invalid, return a 401 Unauthorized response. This approach provides basic security for the endpoint while allowing for future expansion to more comprehensive authentication methods. Document the implementation in the code, including inline comments explaining the authentication logic and the use of NextRequest for request handling. Add a TODO comment for future improvements, such as supporting additional authentication methods or integrating with an authentication library. Test the authentication flow thoroughly to ensure the security of the token endpoint. Refer to the NextRequest implementation pattern for token validation in Next.js App Router as recommended in the Next.js documentation and GitHub discussions[3][4][5].

## 8. Verify Environment Variable Consistency [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure environment variables are used consistently across the unified endpoint.
### Details:
Verify that LIVEKIT_API_KEY, LIVEKIT_API_SECRET, and any other required environment variables are consistently used across all token generation flows in the consolidated endpoint. Document all required environment variables in the API documentation.
<info added on 2025-05-17T04:42:47.802Z>
A comprehensive audit of environment variable usage has been completed. All LiveKit-related environment variables (LIVEKIT_API_KEY, LIVEKIT_API_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL) are used consistently and securely, with server-only secrets never exposed to the client. Only NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL is referenced client-side. All AI and third-party environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, PERPLEXITY_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, etc.) are exclusively accessed server-side within API routes such as /api/image-gen, /api/fact-check, and /api/youtube-search, with no evidence of accidental client exposure. All required environment variables are documented in env.example, and actual usage matches the documentation. No leaks, misuses, or inconsistencies were found. All process.env references are correct and safe for MVP deployment. Documentation for all environment variables has been updated in the API documentation, ensuring clarity and maintainability for future development and onboarding. <update timestamp="2025-05-17T04:42:43Z">Environment variable consistency audit complete. All findings confirm secure and consistent usage across the unified endpoint.</update>
</info added on 2025-05-17T04:42:47.802Z>

## 9. Implement Multiple HTTP Methods in Route Handler [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Structure the consolidated endpoint to support multiple HTTP methods in a single route.ts file.
### Details:
Following Next.js App Router patterns, implement both GET and POST methods in the same route.ts file. Export separate async functions for each HTTP method (GET, POST) from the route.ts file. Ensure proper request handling and response formatting for each method according to Next.js documentation. Test each method independently to verify correct functionality.
<info added on 2025-05-17T04:58:10.993Z>
<update timestamp="2025-05-17T04:58:06Z">Review and update `src/app/api/get-token/route.ts` to ensure both GET and POST handlers are correctly exported as async functions following Next.js App Router patterns. Each handler should independently process requests, validate the Authorization header (Bearer token), and extract required parameters (`room`, `username`, `refresh`). Both handlers should delegate to a shared `handleTokenRequest` function for consistent logic. Test edge cases including missing Authorization header, missing required parameters, and invalid JSON body in POST requests. Confirm that error responses and HTTP status codes (400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized, 500 for server errors) match API documentation. Add or update unit/integration tests to cover GET with query parameters, POST with JSON body, and all error scenarios. Manually test using `curl` for both methods and record responses. Ensure API documentation (README) clearly describes both GET and POST methods, required parameters, and response formats.</update>

## 10. Verify Audit Recommendations Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all recommendations from the audit (Task 2) are properly implemented.
### Details:
Double-check that src/app/api/get-token/route.ts is the only remaining token endpoint. Verify that all required logic from livekit/route.ts and refresh-token/route.ts has been merged. Confirm that create-agent/route.ts has been removed or properly feature-flagged if needed. Run ts-prune after all changes to ensure no new orphaned exports remain.
<info added on 2025-05-17T05:00:23.064Z>
Inspect the `src/app/api` directory to confirm that only the `get-token` route remains and that legacy directories (`livekit`, `refresh-token`, `create-agent`) have been removed. Search the codebase for any references to `api/livekit`, `api/refresh-token`, or `api/create-agent` to ensure no lingering imports or routes exist. Review the commit history and compare key grants and flows to verify that logic from `livekit/route.ts` and `refresh-token/route.ts` has been fully integrated into `get-token/route.ts`. Confirm that `create-agent/route.ts` is either removed or feature-flagged if still present. Run `ts-prune` to detect any orphaned exports that might indicate leftover code from legacy endpoints. Update the subtask with findings and record any issues before marking as done.
