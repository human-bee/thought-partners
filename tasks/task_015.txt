# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Authentication and Middleware for /api/get-token Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate robust authentication and middleware for the /api/get-token endpoint, supporting multiple authentication methods and enhanced security features. This task should be addressed after the MVP is stable.
# Details:
Select and integrate a well-established authentication library or service (such as OAuth2, JWT, or a third-party provider) to secure the /api/get-token endpoint. Support multiple authentication methods (e.g., API keys, OAuth2, and potentially multi-factor authentication) based on project requirements. Implement middleware for logging all access attempts, input validation to prevent injection attacks, and enhanced security measures such as rate limiting and HTTPS enforcement. Ensure sensitive credentials are never stored in plain text and utilize secure secrets management. Follow best practices for API authentication, including the principle of least privilege, secure storage of secrets, and regular security audits. Document the authentication flow and middleware logic for future maintenance and developer onboarding[1][2][3][4][5].

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the /api/get-token endpoint enforces authentication for all supported methods and rejects unauthorized requests. Test successful and failed authentication scenarios for each method. Confirm that logging middleware records all access attempts with relevant metadata. Validate that rate limiting and input validation are effective against abuse and injection attacks. Ensure all communication occurs over HTTPS and that no sensitive credentials are exposed in logs or responses. Conduct code reviews and, if possible, a security audit to confirm adherence to best practices. Review documentation for completeness and clarity.
