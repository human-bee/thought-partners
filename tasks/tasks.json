Next, the blob will be uploaded to Tldraw’s asset store via `const asset = await controller.editor.uploadAsset(blob);`, which returns an object with `src` and `meta` properties. The shape object will then be updated to use `type: 'image'` and `props: { asset: asset.src, w: asset.meta.width, h: asset.meta.height }`, replacing the previous markdown-based `note` shape. The `toRichText` markdown code for images will be removed, and the rest of the controller and transcript logic will remain unchanged. The shape ID generation will be kept as is, and the blob fetch and upload code will be inserted before the shape definition block. This ensures images are rendered as native Tldraw Image shapes, backed by the asset store.</content></details>\n</info added on 2025-05-17T07:54:33.034Z>",

Implement middleware for logging all access attempts, input validation to prevent injection attacks, and enhanced security measures such as rate limiting and HTTPS enforcement. Ensure sensitive credentials are never stored in plain text and utilize secure secrets management. Follow best practices for API authentication, including the principle of least privilege, secure storage of secrets, and regular security audits.

Ensure all communication occurs over HTTPS and that no sensitive credentials are exposed in logs or responses. Conduct code reviews and, if possible, a security audit to confirm adherence to best practices. Review documentation for completeness and clarity.",
